Collective motions of many self-driven objects are observed in various situations.
For example, human crowds, car traffics, swarm bird ,biological cells, swarm robot and so on 
are famous as such collective motions.
In previous study, we carried out experiments about
a bidirectional movement with Seasory-Motor-Mapping (SMM) robots based on a nonlinear function 
in pseudo-ellipse course.
We found a transition phenomenon from bidirectional movement to unidirectional flow.
In this study, we made a neural network (NN) model which can recognize a one-dimensional image and
make autonomous movements of small robots in a simple circuit.
And we compare their trajectories and flow rate with them for SMM robots in same circuit. 
From those experiments we found that the NN with one-dimensional image 
can make robots avoid obstacles smoothly and keep bidirectional movement for a long time successfuly.
Moreover, we also proved the neural network model is better than seasory motor mapping model 
in robots flow rate, time of keep one-direction flow and turn around number in our simple circuit.
